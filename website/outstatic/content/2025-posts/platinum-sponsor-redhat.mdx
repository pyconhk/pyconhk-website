In the world of technology, some partnerships just make sense. They feel less like a business arrangement and more like a reunion of kindred spirits, driven by a shared philosophy. Today, we're not just announcing a sponsor; we're celebrating a core part of our ecosystem.

PyCon Hong Kong is incredibly proud to welcome [Red Hat](https://access.redhat.com/recognition), the world's leading provider of enterprise open source solutions, as a **Platinum Sponsor** for 2025!

## **More Than a Sponsor‚ÄîA Foundational Partner**

To understand why this partnership is so significant, you have to look at the DNA of both Python and Red Hat. For us, Python is more than a language; it‚Äôs a community built on collaboration, openness, and the power of shared knowledge. For Red Hat, open source isn't just a model; it's their identity. For decades, they have championed the very principles that our community holds dear: collaboration, transparency, and meritocracy.

Red Hat doesn‚Äôt just use open source; they live and breathe it. They build in the open, contribute back to thousands of projects, and cultivate the ecosystems that allow technologies like Python to not just survive, but thrive on a global, enterprise scale. This isn't a top-down sponsorship; it's a partnership between two communities that believe in the same thing: that the best solutions are built together.

## **From Your First** `print("Hello, World")` **to a Global Cloud**

Whether you realize it or not, if you're a Python developer, your work is deeply intertwined with the world Red Hat has helped build.

Think about the journey of your code:

- You write a Python script. Where does it run? Very likely on a **Linux** server, the operating system that Red Hat has championed and hardened into the enterprise-grade bedrock of modern IT: **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)**.
- You need to automate your deployment, manage configurations, and orchestrate complex workflows. You turn to **Ansible**, the powerful automation platform. And what is Ansible built with? **Python.** It‚Äôs a tool for the community, built with the community's language.
- Your application needs to be scalable, resilient, and cloud-native. You package it into containers and deploy it on Kubernetes. Red Hat's **OpenShift** provides the industry's leading hybrid cloud platform to do just that, creating a seamless path for Python applications to go from a developer's laptop to a global audience.

Red Hat provides the industrial-grade engine room that powers the Python revolution. They build the roads, bridges, and power grids that our code travels on.

## **Feeling Our Most Ambitious PyCon Yet**

Red Hat‚Äôs commitment as a Platinum Sponsor is the rocket fuel for PyCon Hong Kong 2025. This support goes directly into building a conference that reflects the ambition and ingenuity of our community. It allows us to:

- **Curate a world-class program** featuring pioneers and experts at the intersection of Python, AI, cloud, and automation.
- **Lower barriers to entry**, making the event more accessible to students, career-changers, and developers from all backgrounds.
- **Create unparalleled networking spaces** where a simple conversation can spark the next big open source project or a career-defining opportunity.
- **Invest in a high-quality hybrid experience**, ensuring the spirit of open knowledge-sharing reaches everyone, everywhere.

## **Let's Build the Future, Openly**

We are profoundly grateful to Red Hat for their visionary support. This partnership is a powerful affirmation of the Python community's role in driving the future of technology. It‚Äôs a shared commitment to innovation that is open, collaborative, and accessible to all.

Please join us in giving a massive thank you to Red Hat for being a true champion of the open source world. We can‚Äôt wait to see what we‚Äôll all build together.

Let's code, collaborate, and create at PyCon HK 2025! üêßüêç
