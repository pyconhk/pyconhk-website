The energy at PyCon Hong Kong is always incredible, and one of the most anticipated highlights is our annual Sprint Day. We‚Äôve been absolutely blown away by the community's enthusiasm this year‚Äîso much so that our main conference tickets have **completely sold out!**

But we believe a sold-out sign shouldn‚Äôt stop the most passionate builders from joining the collaboration. That's why we‚Äôve created **a special opportunity** for those eager to participate in our Sprint Day. 

To ensure you can join us and have a smooth, productive, and enjoyable experience, we‚Äôve put together this essential preparation guide.

## **The Golden Rule: Preparation is Key**

Our Sprint Day is designed for deep, focused collaboration. To make that happen, we need everyone to arrive with their development environments ready to go. By completing these steps, you‚Äôre not only setting yourself up for success but also respecting the valuable time of our sprint leaders and your fellow participants. This ensures we can dive straight into solving problems and building amazing things, rather than troubleshooting installations.

### **Your Pre-Sprint Checklist**

Please review and complete the following steps *before* arriving on Sprint Day (October 12th).

### **1. Check Your Gear: Laptop & System Requirements**

A productive sprint starts with the right tools. Please ensure the laptop you bring meets the following minimum specifications:

- **CPU:** 2 Cores or more
- **RAM:** 8 GB or more

And, of course, the developer's most essential accessory: **don't forget your charger!**

### **2. Join Your Digital Squadron: The Discord Channels**

Communication is vital. We have created dedicated Discord channels for each sprint project. These channels are your central hub for pre-event discussion. By joining, you can:

- **Get a head start** by understanding the project goals.
- **Interact directly with your sprint leader** and ask questions beforehand.
- **Connect with fellow participants** and start building a rapport.

You can find a complete, up-to-date list of all sprint project channels on our official Sprint Day page.

### **3. The Crucial Step: The Mandatory Installation Test**

This is the most important preparation task. Our sprint leaders have invested time in creating **an "installation test" or setup guide** for their respective projects. This is designed to verify that your computer has all the necessary dependencies, libraries, and software installed correctly ***before* you arrive**.

**Please be aware:** To ensure the productivity of the entire group, our **sprint leaders may not be able to accommodate participants whose systems do not meet the project's requirements or have not passed the installation test**. A successful setup is your ticket to guaranteeing you can participate fully from the moment we begin.

## **Sold Out? Not for Sprinters! Your Ticket Quest Awaits üéüÔ∏è**

You heard right‚Äîour main batch of tickets was snapped up in record time! We're incredibly grateful for the overwhelming support.

However, we've **reserved a special, limited batch of new tickets exclusively** for those who are passionate about contributing to our Sprint Day. To ensure these tickets go to dedicated sprinters ready to dive in, we‚Äôve created a small challenge.

Solve the puzzle in the repository below to find the key to unlocking this new batch of tickets.
