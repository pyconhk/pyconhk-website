Every great ambition needs a launchpad. For a community-driven event like PyCon Hong Kong, our ambition is fueled by the passion of our developers and powered by partners who don't just see the future, but actively build its foundations. Today, we are ecstatic to announce a partnership with a true titan of technology.

Please join us in giving a thunderous welcome to [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/), who is joining the PyCon HK 2025 mission as our **Diamond Sponsor** üíé!**

## **The Engine Room of the Digital World**

For nearly two decades, AWS has been more than a service provider; it has been the bedrock upon which the modern internet is built. It‚Äôs the invisible, powerful force that delivers our favorite apps, crunches the data for scientific breakthroughs, and allows fledgling startups to dream on a global scale from day one.

With an ever-expanding universe of over 240 fully featured services, AWS provides the ultimate digital LEGO set for builders. This immense power is delivered from a global network of 120 Availability Zones across 38 regions, creating a truly worldwide stage for innovation. With new regions on the horizon from Chile to Saudi Arabia, AWS is relentless in its mission to bring the cloud everywhere. Millions, from garage-based innovators to the world‚Äôs largest enterprises, rely on AWS to build with agility, dream bigger, and define what‚Äôs next.

## **Python and AWS: The Symbiotic Duo**

If AWS is the architecture of the cloud, then Python is its universal language. For countless developers in our community, AWS isn't a distant concept; it's our daily workspace. The connection is a natural and powerful one.

We use Python and the `boto3` SDK to orchestrate vast and complex infrastructure with just a few lines of code. We write elegant, powerful serverless functions with AWS Lambda that scale infinitely without breaking a sweat. We sculpt the future of artificial intelligence on Amazon SageMaker and deploy sophisticated web applications that serve millions.

AWS's sponsorship of PyCon Hong Kong is a profound recognition of this symbiotic relationship. It's a salute to every developer who has ever deployed a container, trained a model, or configured a database on their platform. It‚Äôs an investment in the very people who transform AWS's powerful tools into tangible, world-changing solutions.

## **What This Means for Our Community's Journey**

AWS's monumental Diamond sponsorship acts as a catalyst, supercharging our ability to deliver a truly world-class experience. This support allows us to:

- **Curate an unforgettable program** with more pioneering talks, deep-dive workshops, and visionary keynotes.
- **Bring the world's brightest minds** to Hong Kong, creating a global melting pot of ideas and expertise.
- **Amplify the conference experience** for every attendee with state-of-the-art resources and exceptional networking opportunities.
- **Forge stronger connections** within our community, sparking collaborations that will last long after the conference ends.

This partnership ensures PyCon HK 2025 will not just be an event, but a landmark moment for the tech community in our region.

## **Let's Build What's Next, Together**

We are incredibly grateful to Amazon Web Services (AWS) for their immense vote of confidence in the Hong Kong Python community. Their support is a shared declaration that the future is not something we wait for‚Äîit is something we build.

Please join us in thanking AWS for being a foundational partner in our mission. We are incredibly excited to see the sparks of innovation that will fly when this community gets together.

Let's get ready to build what's next, together! üöÄüêç
