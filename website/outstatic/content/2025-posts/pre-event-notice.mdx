## **5. Sprint Day & Workshop Updates: Get Prepared!**

To ensure everyone has a productive and enjoyable experience during our hands-on Sprint Day and Workshops, we have a few important updates. Preparation is key, so please read the following carefully. 

### **Join Our Dedicated Discord Channels**

We have created dedicated Discord channels for each sprint and workshop. These channels are your primary resource for pre-event communication.By joining, you can:

- Get a head start by understanding the project goals and background.

- Interact directly with your sprint leader and ask questions.

- Connect with other participants who will be working on the project with you.

Channels:

- Sprints: [https://pycon.hk/sprint](https://pycon.hk/sprint)

- OpenTelemetry Workshop: [https://discord.gg/5aDZKbExef](https://discord.gg/5aDZKbExef) 

- Kubernetes CI-CD Workshop: [https://discord.gg/9Y2pWnGFrY](https://discord.gg/9Y2pWnGFrY) 

### **Mandatory Preparation: The Installation Test**

To maximize our time for collaboration, our sprint leaders have prepared an installation test or setup guide for their projects.

This test is designed to verify that your computer has all the necessary dependencies, libraries, and software installed before you arrive. A successful setup ensures you can spend your time contributing and learning, not troubleshooting your environment.

**Please be aware: To ensure the productivity of the group and respect the leader's time, sprint leaders may not be able to accommodate participants whose systems do not meet the project's requirements**. Completing the installation test successfully is the best way to secure your spot and guarantee you can participate fully.

### **6. What to Expect**

- **Booths and Poster Sessions:** Sponsors and community booths are ready to dive deep into Python topics with you.

- **Job Board:** Check out postings and network freely for opportunities.

- **Booth Stamp Journey:** Engage with booth and poster session facilitators, gather 9 stamps to qualify for gift redemption. (Each person can redeem only one gift. Gifts are limited and distributed on a first-come, first-served basis.)

### **7. Contact Information**

**Online Support:** Follow @pyconhk on Instagram and DM if help is required.

**Discord Channel**: Join our discord group through [https://bit.ly/pyconhk](https://bit.ly/pyconhk) and ask for help in our general channel!

**Feedback:** Complete the post-event survey to help us improve and enter the lucky draw.
