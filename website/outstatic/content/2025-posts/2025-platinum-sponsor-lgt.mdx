The success of a community-driven event like PyCon Hong Kong is built on the shared passion of its members and the crucial support of visionary partners. Today, we are absolutely delighted to announce a significant partnership that embodies this spirit of forward-thinking collaboration.

For those who may not be familiar with them, LGT Private Banking is not just a sponsor; they are a global powerhouse in international private banking and asset management. What makes LGT unique is its foundation: the group has been fully controlled by the Princely Family of Liechtenstein for over 90 years. This heritage brings a rare perspective focused on stability, long-term thinking, and sustainable value creation‚Äîprinciples that resonate deeply within the open-source community.

With an impressive CHF 359.6 billion (USD 451.6 billion) in assets under management (as of 30 June 2025), LGT serves wealthy private individuals and institutional clients across the globe. Their team of over 6,000 dedicated professionals operates from more than 30 locations, spanning Europe, Asia, the Americas, Australia, and the Middle East, demonstrating a truly global reach and a profound understanding of diverse markets.

## **A Shared Commitment to Empowering Growth and Innovation**

At first glance, a partnership between a premier private bank and a Python conference might seem unexpected. But when you look closer at LGT‚Äôs core mission‚Äîto empower growth and innovation‚Äîthe connection becomes crystal clear.

In today‚Äôs world, technology is the primary driver of innovation across every industry, and finance is at the forefront of this transformation. Python, with its versatility, powerful libraries for data science, and robust frameworks, is the language behind much of the fintech revolution, algorithmic trading, risk management, and data-driven financial modeling.

LGT's support for PyCon Hong Kong is a testament to their recognition of technology's pivotal role in shaping the future. It is a powerful statement that acknowledges the Python ecosystem as a critical engine for building the tools and solutions of tomorrow. Their sponsorship is an investment not just in our conference, but in the people who are actively coding that future.

## **What This Means for the PyCon HK Community**

LGT's generous Platinum sponsorship directly translates into a more impactful and enriching experience for every attendee. This support enables us to:
